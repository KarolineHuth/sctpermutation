# Structural Change Test - Permutation Alternative

Equal parameter estimates across subgroups - measurement invariance - isa substantial requirement of statistical tests. Ignoring subgroup differencesposes a major threat to study replicability, model specification and theorydevelopment. One powerful, statistical method that allows to test for mea-surement invariance is structural change tests. A core element of the testsare the empirical fluctuation process. In case of measurement invariance thefluctuation process asymptotically follows a Brownian bridge. This asymp-totic assumption further provides the basis for inference. However, in thispaper we show that in finite samples the empirical fluctuation process doesnot follow a Brownian bridge, thus, methods of obtaining the sampling dis-tribution are incorrect and the p-value misspecified. Therefore, we proposeand implement an alternative solution to obtaining the sampling distribution- permutation approaches. Permutation approaches obtain the sampling dis-tribution through resampling of the dataset, avoiding unmet distributionalassumptions. Through simulation we show that the permutation approachserves as a viable alternative to obtain the sampling distribution, permittingvalid inferential conclusions.

The functions contained in this repository allow for simulation of the structural change test in finite samples both for linear regression models and Gaussian graphical models. Furthermore, the repository also contains code to implement the permutation alternative.
