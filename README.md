# Structural Change Test - Permutation Alternative

Equal parameter estimates across subgroups - measurement invariance - is a substantial requirement of statistical tests. Ignoring subgroup differencesposes a major threat to study replicability, model specification and theorydevelopment. One powerful, statistical method that allows to test for measurement invariance is structural change tests. A core element of the testsare the empirical fluctuation process. In case of measurement invariance the fluctuation process asymptotically follows a Brownian bridge. This asymptotic assumption further provides the basis for inference. However, in this paper we show that in finite samples the empirical fluctuation process doesnot follow a Brownian bridge, thus, methods of obtaining the sampling distribution are incorrect and the p-value misspecified. Therefore, we propose and implement an alternative solution to obtaining the sampling distribution- permutation approaches. Permutation approaches obtain the sampling distribution through resampling of the dataset, avoiding unmet distributional assumptions. Through simulation we show that the permutation approach serves as a viable alternative to obtain the sampling distribution, permitting valid inferential conclusions.

The functions contained in this repository allow for simulation of the structural change test in finite samples both for linear regression models and Gaussian graphical models. Furthermore, the repository also contains code to implement the permutation alternative.
